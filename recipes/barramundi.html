            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400°F. Use a little of the olive oil to lightly grease the inside of a 3 quart casserole pan.</li>
                <li>Arrange half of the bell peppers, onions, garlic, and olives on the bottom of the casserole dish.</li>
                <li>Season both sides of the barramundi filets with the paprika and a good pinch each sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place on top of the veggies and olives. Arrange half of the herb sprigs on top.</li>
                <li>Place the remaining peppers, onions, garlic, and olives over the top of the fish. Season with a little more salt and pepper. Add the remaining herb sprigs. Drizzle the remaining olive oil over the top. Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Place in oven and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until fish is cooked through and veggies are tender.</li>
                <li>Let cool slightly and serve with fresh greens, roasted potatoes, and garnish with lemon wedges and fresh parsley. Add an extra drizzle of olive oil, if desired.</li>
