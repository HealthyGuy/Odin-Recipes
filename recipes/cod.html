                <ul>
                    <li>4 fillets sablefish (gindara) (you can also use salmon and sea bass; roughly 1 inch thickness)</li>
                    <li>2 tsp kosher or sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp sake (For cleaning and removing unwanted odor of the fish.)</li>
                    <li>6 Tbsp saikyo miso (kyoto-style white miso))</li>
                    <li>3 Tbsp mirin</li>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Gather all the ingredients. As you will be marinating this fish for a few days, select the freshest fish possible.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2-3 Days Beforehand</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Sprinkle salt over the fish and set aside for 30 minutes. Salt will draw excess moisture and any fishy smell from the fish.  </li>
                <li>In a bowl, add saikyo miso, mirin, and sake (and sugar, if you are using regular white miso).</li>
                <li>Mix all together and pour the marinade into a flat bottom airtight container.</li>
                <li>Pour 2 Tbsp sake over the fish to rinse off the salt. Gently pat dry with a paper towel to remove the moisture. <strong>Do not wash the fish under running water.</strong></li>
                <li>Place the fish in the container and coat both sides of the fish with the marinade.</li>
                <li>lather the fillets with the marinade. Cover the lid and keep in the refrigerator <strong>for up to 2-3 days.</strong> If you prefer less salty (and don't eat this dish with rice, for example), you can cut down to 1 day (or even several hours). It depends on your preference. </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Cooking the Miso Cod</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>With your fingers, remove the marinade off the fish completely. Do not leave excess miso on the fish; otherwise, the fish will burn easily.</li>
                <li>Place the fish <strong>skin side up</strong> on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper/silicone mat.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200ºC) with a rack placed in the center of the oven. For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Bake the fish on parchment paper until the surface is blistered and brown a bit, about 20 minutes. You do not need to flip the fish.</li>
                <li>Carefully remove the fish with a spatula, and remove any burnt miso around the fish. Serve immediately. I serve the fish with thinly sliced red radish and a small green leaf from my backyard for additional color.</li>
